# Issue 27 plan — Learning-to-Publishing workflow documentation

Issue: https://github.com/myaiwouldbemine/myaiwouldbemine-Copy-Learning-Hub/issues/27
Accountable Builder: Claude Code (sole). Base: b4d9d74 (main).

## Goal
Document the confirmed Learning-to-Publishing workflow, roles and the two independent Issue lifecycles in `README.md`, and move `RAW_DATA/README.md` to the ORIGINAL/GENERATED layout.

## Scope (documentation only)
- `README.md`: new section "Learning-to-Publishing Workflow｜教材製作與發布流程" with Phases A–D, a full Mermaid flowchart, a role-responsibility matrix, and a Mermaid diagram of the Learning Record and Engineering Task lifecycles (one-to-many, independent closure). Existing sections are kept; only section numbers after the insertion shift, and the stable explicit anchor `#learning-to-publishing-workflow` is added. Repository-structure example gains RAW_DATA, records, RELEARNING_SUPPLEMENTS. LEC08 case: Learning #26 / Engineering #24 / PR #25.
- `RAW_DATA/README.md`: `RAW_DATA/<subject>/<unit>/ORIGINAL|GENERATED/`, read-only, SHA-256, versioning, licence, Git exclusion, local backup, relative link to the root README workflow section; existing rules preserved.
- `records/ISSUE-27/` Plan and Result.

## Out of scope
GOVERNANCE.md, AGENTS.md, CI, lifecycle scripts, Issue templates, teaching content semantics, any RAW_DATA PDF/ZIP commit. `.gitignore` already excludes `/RAW_DATA/**` except its README, so no change.

## Implementation plan
1. Commit this Plan alone.
2. Edit the two READMEs.
3. Verify: `git diff --check`, link/anchor check, `mkdocs build --strict`, unit tests, `verify_plan_records`, Mermaid syntax check if a renderer is available (else NOT RUN, with GitHub rendering checked on the PR), `git ls-files RAW_DATA`.
4. Draft PR, Result, Self-Review block, Ready, gated merge, Pages run and SHA readback, archive and readback, close.

## Verification strategy
Each criterion reported separately as PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/PENDING/NOT RUN. README is not part of the MkDocs site, so MkDocs only proves the build is unaffected; GitHub Mermaid rendering is checked separately.

## Revision history
- r0: initial plan.
